### Installation

You'll need to install Node.js >=v14.16+ (Recommended Version) (NPM comes along with it)

Use terminal and navigate to the project (tailadmin) root. 

- Clone the repository with the following command:

- run : <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies

- Then run : <code>npm start</code> to run the project in dev mode

Now, in the browser go to <code>localhost:3000</code>

**For Production Build**
Run : <code>npm run build</code>

This command will generate a Build folder in the root of your template that you can upload to your server.
